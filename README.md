[![JetBrains incubator project](http://jb.gg/badges/incubator.svg)]

This is an experimental plugin exploring the integration of [SCIP](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip)
into JetBrains IDEs. Right now the plugin can consume SCIP files and provide navigation based on that;
support for generating SCIP files will be added at a later time.

The plugin is not yet published to the marketplace; please build it from source if you want to play with it.
